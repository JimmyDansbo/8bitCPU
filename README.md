# 8-bit CPU
My attempt at building an 8 bit CPU from discrete logic gates

Initially the CPU will be designed in Logisim, specifically
Logisim Version 2.7.2.255 from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/files/2.7.x/2.7.x%20Development/

I am trying to create circuits in Logisim that can be build with real
chips like the CD4516B
